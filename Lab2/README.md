**QAQC and Model Evaluation**

This repository contains quality assurance and conversion scripts for five different datasets essential for a final GIS project. The datasets were acquired from various sources and underwent rigorous QA/QC processes using ArcGIS Pro Jupyter Notebook. Upon completion of QA/QC, the datasets were converted and uploaded to a remote PostgreSQL database using Spatial Database Engine (SDE) for seamless integration and analysis.

Datasets:
* BMSB Data from EDD Maps: This dataset provides observations of Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs (BMSB) sourced from EDD Maps, contributing valuable insights for pest management studies.
* Minnesota State and Cities Boundary: Boundary data delineating the administrative boundaries of Minnesota's cities and townships, obtained from the MN Geospatial Commons.
* Weather Data: Weather data sourced from the Mesonet API, offering access to comprehensive weather information collected by the Iowa State University Mesonet network.
* Land Cover of Minnesota 2019: High-resolution land cover data for Minnesota in 2019, sourced from the Natural Resources Department, facilitating land use and environmental studies.
* Minnesota Digital Elevation Model (DEM): A Digital Elevation Model with 30-meter resolution, obtained from the MN Geospatial Commons, crucial for terrain analysis and visualization.

Each dataset underwent thorough QA/QC processes utilizing ArcGIS Pro Jupyter Notebook to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Subsequently, the datasets were converted to PostgreSQL-compatible formats using Spatial Database Engine (SDE) tools. The converted datasets were were then uploaded to a remote PostgreSQL database.
